# Machine-Learning-Titanic-Project
The data set is Titanic Dataset. The dataset is collected from kaggel https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data The data has been split into two groups: . training set (train.csv) . test set (test.csv) The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. We were given 891 passenger samples for our training set and their associated labels of whether or not the passenger survived. For each passenger, we were given his/her passenger class, name, sex, age, number ofsiblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket number, fare, cabin embarked, and port of embarkation. For the test data, we had 418 samples in the same format. We can use Naïve Bayes Classification algorithm to predict whether or not the passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic depending on the different Class,Sex and Age. Bayes’ theorem can be used to make prediction based on prior knowledge and current evidence. We can also use logistic Regression on survival Survival 0 = No, 1 = Yes. In this project i have used Naive Baeys Classification algorithm to predict the surival of passengers in the sinking of Titanic dependng on Class,Sex and Age.
